# PicRenew

AI-powered photo restoration for family memories. Upload an old, faded, or damaged photograph — get back a beautifully restored version in seconds.

Built for the person at 45 dealing with a box of their parents' photos. Not a tech tool. A skilled conservator in your browser.

## What It Does

- **Upload & restore** — drag in a JPG or PNG, get a watermarked preview instantly, purchase to download the full-resolution result
- **Before/after slider** — drag to compare original and restored side by side; share to social with one click
- **AI era estimation** — the app identifies the approximate decade a photo was taken and suggests the right restoration preset automatically
- **Gift a restoration** — buy a restored photo as a gift; the recipient gets an email with a one-click download link, no account required
- **Batch processing** — upload up to 10 photos at once; they process in parallel and arrive as a zip download
- **Credit packs & subscriptions** — pay per restoration or subscribe for a monthly credit allowance
- **Admin dashboard** — restorations per day, revenue, preset popularity, failed job log

## Architecture Decisions

- **Anonymous upload, auth at purchase** — users see a watermarked preview without signing in; Google OAuth is required only at checkout. Maximizes top-of-funnel.
- **Watermark is burned in server-side** — never a CSS overlay. The watermarked preview is a separate image file.
- **Append-only credit ledger** — credits are never mutated, only appended. Every debit, refund, and award is a separate row with an idempotency key.
- **QStash for batch** — each photo in a batch becomes an independent async job, avoiding Vercel serverless timeouts.
- **30-day retention** — restored images are auto-deleted after 30 days; users can re-download within the window.

## Design System

The product uses a **Refined Artisan** aesthetic — warm, unhurried, treats photographs as precious objects.

- **Fonts:** Fraunces (display/headings), Plus Jakarta Sans (body/UI), JetBrains Mono (data/credits)
- **Accent:** `#B5622A` cognac amber — unclaimed territory in the AI photo tools space
- **Background:** `#FAF7F2` archival cream — never pure white
- **Spacing:** 8px base, comfortable density

Full token system in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md). All visual decisions must be grounded there.
